## [10:53] Bead istari-4bg - Update README.md with Safety Net documentation

**Approach:**
Updated README.md to document the claude-code-safety-net plugin integration following the design specification in docs/plans/2025-01-05-safety-net-integration-design.md.

**Changes Made:**
1. Added Safety Net to AI Orchestration toolchain section (after Compound Engineering)
2. Updated Purpose section numbering from 1-5 to 1-6, adding item 4 about operating safely
3. Added troubleshooting entry for handling blocked commands with configuration guidance

**Learnings:**
- Documentation changes require careful attention to existing patterns and consistency
- Design documents provide excellent guidance for precise implementation
- Multiple review layers (Superpowers, Compound Engineering) ensure quality even for docs
- Zero-issue reviews indicate well-planned changes with clear specifications

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Followed existing bullet point formatting in toolchain sections
- Maintained bold emphasis pattern for key concepts (e.g., "**Operate safely**")
- Used consistent troubleshooting structure with bold headings and bullet lists
- Included external reference link to upstream documentation

**Review Process:**
- Superpowers code-reviewer: APPROVED (no issues)
- Compound Engineering workflow:review: APPROVED (zero findings)
- Both reviews confirmed perfect alignment with design specification

## [11:40] Bead istari-4c2 - Update istari-setup.md Section 9 summary report

**Approach:**
Updated Section 9 summary report in istari-setup.md to include Safety Net plugin verification checks across 4 locations.

**Changes Made:**
1. Added Safety Net check to "Claude Code Plugins:" visual status section
2. Updated TOTAL tool count from 23 to 24 for accurate percentage calculation
3. Added Safety Net plugin directory check to installation counter logic
4. Added Safety Net to Success Criteria checklist for setup verification

**Learnings:**
- Bash scripting patterns: Maintained consistency with existing plugin checks using `[ -d ... ] && echo ... || echo ...`
- Installation counter logic: Plugin checks must be added to both visual report AND counter section
- Tool count accuracy: TOTAL must be updated whenever adding new tools to avoid incorrect percentage display
- Success criteria: Users need clear verification paths listed in checklist format

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Directory existence check: `[ -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/cc-marketplace/safety-net ]`
- Conditional echo: `&& echo "  ✅ Safety Net" || echo "  ❌ Safety Net"`
- Counter increment: `((INSTALLED++))`
- Maintained alphabetical-ish ordering after existing plugins

**Review Process:**
- Superpowers code-reviewer: APPROVED WITHOUT CHANGES
- Perfect plan alignment (100%) across all 4 update locations
- Textbook example of pattern-consistent documentation update

## [11:45] Bead istari-cu8 - Add Safety Net installation to istari-setup.md Section 7

**Approach:**
Added complete Safety Net plugin installation section to istari-setup.md Section 7, following the established pattern used by Superpowers and Compound Engineering plugins.

**Changes Made:**
1. Added new subsection "Safety Net (Command Protection)" after Compound Engineering (line 618)
2. Implemented directory check for existing installation
3. Added interactive user confirmation prompt
4. Included marketplace add command: `claude plugin marketplace add kenryu42/cc-marketplace`
5. Included plugin install command: `claude plugin install safety-net@cc-marketplace`
6. Added success message explaining what Safety Net blocks (force pushes, branch deletions, etc.)

**Learnings:**
- Plugin installation patterns: check existence → prompt user → add marketplace → install plugin → confirm success
- Interactive bash prompts: `read -p "prompt" -n 1 -r` followed by `[[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]` pattern
- User messaging: Include both what was installed AND what it does in success messages
- Section placement: New plugins go after existing plugins, before MCP servers section
- Marketplace namespaces: Safety Net uses `kenryu42/cc-marketplace`, different from `obra/superpowers-marketplace`

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Directory existence check: `[ -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/cc-marketplace/safety-net ]`
- Interactive prompt: `read -p "Install Safety Net now? (y/n) " -n 1 -r`
- Conditional execution: `if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then ... fi`
- Clear user communication with emoji indicators: 📦, ✅, ❌
- Multi-line echo for additional details after success message

**Review Process:**
- Superpowers code-reviewer: APPROVED for commit
- High quality implementation maintaining pattern consistency
- All plan requirements fulfilled across 3 beads (README, Section 9, Section 7)

**Full AIML-347 Integration Complete:**
- ✅ README.md: Safety Net in toolchain, purpose, troubleshooting
- ✅ istari-setup Section 9: Summary report with Safety Net checks, tool count 23→24
- ✅ istari-setup Section 7: Complete installation instructions with user prompts
- ✅ Design document: Created and followed precisely
- ✅ All reviews: Clean approval, zero critical issues

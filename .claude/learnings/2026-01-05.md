## [10:53] Bead istari-4bg - Update README.md with Safety Net documentation

**Approach:**
Updated README.md to document the claude-code-safety-net plugin integration following the design specification in docs/plans/2025-01-05-safety-net-integration-design.md.

**Changes Made:**
1. Added Safety Net to AI Orchestration toolchain section (after Compound Engineering)
2. Updated Purpose section numbering from 1-5 to 1-6, adding item 4 about operating safely
3. Added troubleshooting entry for handling blocked commands with configuration guidance

**Learnings:**
- Documentation changes require careful attention to existing patterns and consistency
- Design documents provide excellent guidance for precise implementation
- Multiple review layers (Superpowers, Compound Engineering) ensure quality even for docs
- Zero-issue reviews indicate well-planned changes with clear specifications

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Followed existing bullet point formatting in toolchain sections
- Maintained bold emphasis pattern for key concepts (e.g., "**Operate safely**")
- Used consistent troubleshooting structure with bold headings and bullet lists
- Included external reference link to upstream documentation

**Review Process:**
- Superpowers code-reviewer: APPROVED (no issues)
- Compound Engineering workflow:review: APPROVED (zero findings)
- Both reviews confirmed perfect alignment with design specification

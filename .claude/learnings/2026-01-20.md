## [15:37] Bead istari-dxv - Add uncle-bob-clean-code-skill.md source file

**Approach:**
Simple file copy operation - copied existing uncle-bob-clean-code skill from ~/jacob-dev/.claude/skills/SKILL.md to istari repo root as uncle-bob-clean-code-skill.md.

**Challenges:**
None - straightforward file copy.

**Learnings:**
- This skill file will serve as the source for distribution via istari-setup
- Uses flat-file-in-namespace pattern: skills/istari/uncle-bob-clean-code.md when installed
- Fills gap in review tools: Compound Engineering has Python/Ruby personas, this adds Java

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Simple file copy with cp command
- Git workflow: stage, commit with descriptive message

**Would Do Differently:**
Nothing - task was straightforward.

## [15:37] Bead istari-dxv - Add uncle-bob-clean-code-skill.md source file

**Approach:**
Simple file copy operation - copied existing uncle-bob-clean-code skill from ~/jacob-dev/.claude/skills/SKILL.md to istari repo root as uncle-bob-clean-code-skill.md.

**Challenges:**
None - straightforward file copy.

**Learnings:**
- This skill file will serve as the source for distribution via istari-setup
- Uses flat-file-in-namespace pattern: skills/istari/uncle-bob-clean-code.md when installed
- Fills gap in review tools: Compound Engineering has Python/Ruby personas, this adds Java

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Simple file copy with cp command
- Git workflow: stage, commit with descriptive message

**Would Do Differently:**
Nothing - task was straightforward.

## [16:00] Bead istari-0ju - Update istari-setup.md to install uncle-bob skill

**Approach:**
Added "Istari Skills" section to istari-setup.md that:
1. Detects istari repo location (from repo or project with installed commands)
2. Checks if uncle-bob-clean-code skill is installed at ~/.claude/skills/istari/
3. Prompts for installation if missing
4. Creates directory and copies source file to target location

**Challenges:**
- Needed to handle two scenarios: running from istari repo vs from project with istari commands installed
- Used conditional logic to find ISTARI_REPO location

**Learnings:**
- Skills installation follows similar pattern to other tools in istari-setup
- Using flat-file-in-namespace pattern: skills/istari/uncle-bob-clean-code.md
- Installation is interactive with clear prompts and feedback

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Conditional path detection (check multiple locations)
- Interactive bash prompts with read -p
- mkdir -p for safe directory creation
- cp for file installation

**Would Do Differently:**
Could add validation to check if skill file format is correct after copying.

## [16:15] Bead istari-rzi - Create istari-update.md command

**Approach:**
Created comprehensive command specification following istari command pattern:
1. Validates running from istari repo (checks for istari-setup.md)
2. Prompts for target .claude directory with validation
3. Creates directory if needed with user confirmation
4. Shows sync plan and confirms before copying
5. Copies command files to target/commands/
6. Copies skills to target/skills/istari/
7. Verifies installation
8. Offers to run istari-setup

**Challenges:**
- Need to handle both relative and absolute paths with ~ expansion
- Must validate .claude directory structure
- Handle missing source files gracefully (partial sync scenario)

**Learnings:**
- Command follows same documentation pattern as other istari commands
- Safety-first approach: validate, confirm, then execute
- Clear visual separation with ━━━ headers
- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
- Repo is source of truth, overwrites target files

**Code Patterns Used:**
- Bash path validation with regex
- read -p for interactive prompts
- Array iteration for file copying
- Conditional file checks with [ -f ]
- mkdir -p for safe directory creation

**Would Do Differently:**
Could add checksum verification to confirm files copied correctly.
